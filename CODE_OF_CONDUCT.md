- Assume good intent, then clarify with specifics.
- Focus feedback on behavior and code, not people.
- Share actionable steps when reporting problems.
- Respect different skill levels and communication styles.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, personal attacks, or discrimination.
- Trolling, intimidation, or hostile language.
- Publishing private information without permission.
- Bad-faith behavior intended to derail collaboration.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may edit, remove, reject, or block contributions and participation that violate this policy.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, open a private security advisory if sensitive details are involved:

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to project spaces, including issues, pull requests, and review discussions.
